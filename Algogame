Section -1 About Effort
It talks about my understanding after going through the repository. I believe before designing a game, it was necessary to have an overview of what 
all elements it will include, and this repository had almost all of it. I read the README file and tried understanding the approach required for designing
a game and necessary documentation.
Section -2 Learning about the Project
In a project it is important for everyone to know in what direction is the project going or what is the current state of the project. 
GitHub is a great platform to maintain all such activities and through discord one can stay connected and seek help easily. 
Project is very well explained and documented. The repository includes all necessary elements by means of which one can understand the project. 
This can be of great help to those who are just starting a new project.
Section –3 Questions about the Project
•	How to use unity and rider? In the repository, it has been mentioned to make rider the default script editor for Unity which I failed to do.
•	Does Github UI and Github CLI/Desktop provide similar functionalities? 
•	Is this game an improved or advanced version of lightbot?
•	What is the objective of Color Swirl Level?
•	Did not understand prototype for 10_28_2019
Section -4 Proposal to make it easier for other folks who are just starting out on the project. Proposed changes in the repo to make it easier for them to better 
understand the project.
I would not delete but rather include some information in the repository. 
More information about use of rider and unity and may be provide some instructions on how to use them. 
Also, there is a list of algorithms under Research Notes tab, this could have been made more informative.
